# prototype
The game prototype built using the core and services is based on **Polymer**, **websockets** and **HTML5** with WebGL. 

The website service requires dependencies in **website/** run the following in that directory,
```
bower install
```

Start the prototype using
```
java -jar core-full-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

This will start up the services configured in **conf/service/launcher.json** in the localhost/default block.
